# Honours-Research-Data-Crunching
Git Repo for the experimentation of my Applied Maths Honours Research Project

This is mostly an initial exploration into the data, and not an in depth project at the
moment.

Hopefully it will expand relatively quickly to something more interesting.


## License
While the project is licensed under MIT, the project will only be available after the 
submission of my research project this year, which means it will be available from 2026.
