# Honours-Research-Data-Crunching
Git Repo for the experimentation of my Applied Maths Honours Research Project

This is mostly an initial exploration into the data, and not an in depth project at the
moment.

Hopefully it will expand relatively quickly to something more interesting.


## License
While the project is licensed under MIT, the project will only be available after the 
submission of my research project this year, which means it will be available from 2026.

### Notes
I have found that the notebook will run with relatively little additional configurations on macOS (and presumably on Linux-based distros as well,) but it does have
issues with Windows, my recomendation is to run this through WSL (Windows subsystem for Linux.)
